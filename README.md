# XmaxRec
## 1. About
XmaxRec is a pipeline library to reconstruct the longitudinal profiles of air showers in simulations of Imaging Atospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). The library is written in Python and utilized the libraries of the ROOT analysis framework. XmaxRec offers several functionalities in cosmic ray air showers simulations like:
* Reconstruction of longitudinal profile based on the xmax optimization
* Reconstruction of xmax value
* Vizualitation of triggered pixels onto the shower plane
